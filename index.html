    <h2>A little about me</h2>

    <p> Thinkful taught me that we never stop growing or learning. When I'm not finding new drills or code challenges to work, I spend my time in a variety of ways. Living in Portland means access to world class soccer, art, nature, and farmers markets.</p>
    <p>As a Timbers and Thorns fan, I joined the 107ist Supporters group. I spend some of my time giving back to the community through volunteer activities that support the growth of soccer and equality throughout our area.The 107ist supporters pull together as a team, which is something I've found I enjoy in my experiance with Thinkful's Enigneering Immersion team approach. </p>
    <p>Programming, especially with an eye towards making things accessible to all, is my current passion. Working with a variety of people in class has helped me find the things I'm good at doing and taught me that it is okay to not know the answer right away. The great thing about tech and me is that we both grow and change with time. Seems like I found my niche.</p>
    <p>My primary tech stack from Thinkful includes HTML, JS,CSS, React, Node.js, Express, Postgresql. I'm looking forward to expanding on that knowledge and learning more languages.</p>

            <p>For readers of genres that don't make the mainstream marketing cut, it can be tough to find the books that you're looking for when searching places like Amazon. I'm and both a reader and writer of lesbian fiction (lesfic) and I've searched countless times for new works in lesbian paranormal fiction and come up with countless books featuring men. Not what I asked for-thanks anyway.</p>
            <p>Frustration with a lack of a solid catalogue of strictly stories that feature women who identify as lesbians became a goal to create such a repository. I'm planning on crowd-sourcing the work of filling the database to the Golden Crown Literary Society-an Organization I've been a proud member of for years and whose sole mission is to promote the entrie genre od lesbian writing.</p>

            <p> The Community Toolbox is an app that allows community run lending libraries work more efficiently in their areas. With slight adaptations the app is designed to help users find the tools they need for home improvement and garden/lawn care tasks without the investment cost and need for storage of seldom used, bulky tools.</p>
            <p>This was a team Capstone project during which I worked as project manager for my five person team. We thankfully had a team member well versed in design. In three weeks we managed to do a prety extensive app involving predictive text search, building a multi table database, public and private routing, JWT auth, and integrated the use of Cloudinary and Google Maps API.OUr demo is availble with the user name and password as Demo.</p>

I worked with a wonderful teammate who also enjoys food so we went with the orgins or peoples favorite dishes. Not only did we learn to build an app together but we learned a little about where different dishes originated</li>
